SELECT 
    SUM(Total_Paid) AS TotalRevenue, 
    CASE 
        WHEN WTT_REF IS NULL THEN 'SEMBR' 
        ELSE 'WTT' 
    END AS Source 
FROM Booking 
WHERE Rental_Start BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31' 
GROUP BY CASE WHEN WTT_REF IS NULL THEN 'SEMBR' ELSE 'WTT' END;
```

### 3. Track bike locations:
