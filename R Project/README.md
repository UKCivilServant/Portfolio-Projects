Data Analysis of EPL 2019/20 Season - The Lockdown Games
Overview
This project analyzes the 2019/20 English Premier League (EPL) season, with a special focus on the matches played during the COVID-19 lockdown. The analysis explores how the absence of fans and other unique circumstances affected team performances, player statistics, and match outcomes. Using R for data analysis and visualization, the project provides an in-depth examination of the "lockdown games" period.

Objectives
Investigate trends in team and player performances during the lockdown period.
Analyze the impact of external factors, such as fan absence, on match outcomes.
Develop interactive tools to explore season-level insights.
Key Insights
Identified significant shifts in home/away advantages during lockdown games.
Analyzed player performance changes and team strategies pre- and post-lockdown.
Highlighted key performance metrics (e.g., possession rates, goals scored, defensive strengths) through detailed visualizations.
Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed raw EPL match data into a structured format suitable for analysis, including handling missing values, feature engineering, and creating new variables such as goal differentials and possession metrics.
Statistical Analysis and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted in-depth exploratory data analysis to uncover performance trends, including evaluating the impact of factors like home advantage, player absence, and fan attendance during the lockdown period. Utilized visual and statistical techniques to identify patterns and anomalies in match outcomes, possession metrics, and player statistics.
Comparative Analysis: Analyzed and visualized pre-lockdown vs. post-lockdown performance trends for teams and players, highlighting significant changes in gameplay dynamics using advanced clustering and regression techniques.
Machine Learning Applications: Leveraged machine learning algorithms (e.g., decision trees, random forests) to predict match outcomes based on pre-match statistics and identify key performance indicators for players and teams.
Visualizations
Player Performance Heatmaps: Compare individual player contributions in terms of goals, assists, and overall match impact.
Team Metrics Analysis: Analyze team performance in possession, shots, goals, and defensive stats across the season.
Impact of Lockdown: Interactive dashboards exploring how game dynamics changed during the lockdown period.
Tools and Technologies
Language: R
Libraries: dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, shiny, lubridate
Data Source: EPL match statistics (details can be added depending on the source, e.g., public databases or scraped data)
